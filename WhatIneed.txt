What I Need:

Page 1:(Most Important)
- Tabs for Key and Custom Keys
- Make png clickable buttons
- Png will randomly appear onto screen
- png can be draggable 
(I want to see what is needed for this, 
I can ask my web programming teacher for javascript help)

Page 2:
- Scrollable page, images grey out when hover to reveal title

Page 3:
- Map, zoom in and drag function.

Questions:
- Is it hard to have all of these on one website page?
- (Like how I have separate pages for each thing on my website)
- I can decide how much work I want to do for this, 
I can create little samples or just focus on part 1.
I just need to make something that is interactive.
